  ## LIST ENTRIES IN ARP_CACHE 
    arp -a

arp -a is used to list all the mappings of the table saved by arp as an arp cache. If arp doesnot find any IP in its cache then it broadcast in the network for finding the user with that IP and would get a response as MAC address which it stores.

   ## VICTIM IP
   We would be required with the victim IP and router IP through which the victim is being connected.
